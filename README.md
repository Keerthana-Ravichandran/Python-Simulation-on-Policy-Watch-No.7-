Policy Watch No.7 titled "Winning Voter Confidence: Fixing India's Faulty VVPAT-based Audit of EVMs" discusses the issues surrounding the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in India and proposes solutions for improving the accuracy and transparency of the election process.

    The author argues that the use of Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) is not enough to ensure the integrity of the voting process and proposes the use of statistical sampling methods to conduct post-election audits. 

    The paper provides a detailed analysis of different sampling methods and their effectiveness in improving the accuracy of election results. 

    The author also proposes the use of state-level populations for sampling rather than parliamentary or assembly constituencies. The paper includes tables and charts that can be used to simulate and understand the sampling process. 

Here are the steps you can follow to create a Python simulation based on the findings of Policy Watch No. 7:

Define the problem: 
      The first step is to define the problem you are trying to solve. In this case, the problem is the faulty VVPAT-based audit of EVMs used in Indian elections.
And the author argue that the right population for sampling is not the assembly constituency, not the parliamentary constituency, not the entire country, but the state.Why? 

Gather data:
      Gather data related to the problem. You can use publicly available data or create your own dataset.

Define assumptions: 
       Based on the data you have gathered, define assumptions that will be used in your simulation. 
For example, you can assume that the number of votes cast for each candidate is random and follows a certain distribution.

Build the simulation model:
      Create a Python program that simulates the election process using the data and assumptions defined earlier. 
The program should take into account the number of voters, the number of candidates, the distribution of votes, and the VVPAT-based audit process.

Analyze the results:
      Run the simulation and analyze the results. Use visualization tools like Altair to plot the data and understand the trends and patterns.
